NightShield do not collect any data. No internet connection is used or created. The application has access to the microphone, but do not save anything. The audio captured with the microphone (only when the shield mode is activated) is only used to compute the power of the audio, and is directly used (no data stored more than a few seconds). All the code is open source and available [here](https://github.com/DorianBDev/NightShield).
